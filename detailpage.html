            <p>Haarlem Oude Stad is known for its well-preserved historic center, which boasts a stunning array of 
                medieval and Renaissance architecture. The city's layout, with its narrow cobbled streets and 
                winding canals, reflects its centuries-old heritage. 
            </p>
            <p>The heart of Haarlem's Oude Stad is the Grote Markt (Great 
                Market Square). This picturesque square is surrounded by 
                beautiful historical buildings, including the impressive 
                St. Bavo Church (Grote Kerk) and the  Town Hall (Stadhuis). 
                The Grote Markt is also home to a vibrant market and various
                 cafes and restaurants.

                Molen De Adriaan is a historic windmill located in Haarlem,
                Netherlands. It is a well-known  landmark and tourist 
                attraction in the city. The windmill was originally built in 
                1779 but was destroyed by fire in 1932. However, it was 
                subsequently reconstructed in the 21st century and has 
                been open to the public since 2002.
            </p>
            <p>Teylers Museum is one of the oldest museums in the 
                Netherlands and is celebrated for its unique blend of art, 
                science, and historical artifacts. The museum's collections 
                include paintings, fossils, scientific instruments, and rare 
                books. The neoclassical architecture of the building itself 
                is a sight to see.
